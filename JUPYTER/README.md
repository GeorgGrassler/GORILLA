# JUPYTER

In this folder Jupyter notebooks are provided to illustrate how to use *GORILLA*, especially in combination with PYTHON. 

The notebooks explain the different settings that can be set in the `INPUT/*.inp` files, as well as how to access these options in a PYTHON script using the package *f90nml*. 

Furthermore, these notebooks aim to show how to execute *GORILLA* and plot the results. In that regard several run-examples are provided, which were originally developed in MATLAB by *Michael Scheidt* and ported to PYTHON.
