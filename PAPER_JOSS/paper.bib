	abstract = {A numerical integration method for guiding-center orbits of charged particles in toroidal fusion devices with three-dimensional field geometry is described. Here, high order interpolation of electromagnetic fields in space is replaced by a special linear interpolation, leading to locally linear Hamiltonian equations of motion with piecewise constant coefficients. This approach reduces computational effort and noise sensitivity, while the conservation of total energy, magnetic moment and phase space volume is retained. The underlying formulation treats motion in piecewise linear fields exactly and, thus, preserves the non-canonical symplectic form. The algorithm itself is only quasi-geometric due to a series expansion in the orbit parameter. For practical purposes, an expansion to the fourth order retains geometric properties down to computer accuracy in typical examples. When applied to collisionless guiding-center orbits in an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator configuration, the method demonstrates stable long-term orbit dynamics conserving invariants. In Monte Carlo evaluation of transport coefficients, the computational efficiency of quasi-geometric integration is an order of magnitude higher than with a standard fourth order Runge–Kutta integrator.},

    abstract = {GORILLA: Guiding-center ORbit Integration with Local Linearization Approach GORILLA computes guiding-center orbits for charged particles of given mass, charge and energy in toroidal fusion devices with three-dimensional field geometry. This guiding-center orbit code is designed to be used in scientific plasma physics simulations in the field of magnetic confinement fusion. The guiding-center orbits are traced via a quasi-geometric integration method described in Ref. [1]. There, high order interpolation of electromagnetic fields in space is replaced by a special linear interpolation, leading to locally linear Hamiltonian equations of motion with piecewise constant coefficients. The underlying formulation treats the motion in the piecewise linear fields exactly. This further leads to conservation of total energy, magnetic moment and phase space volume. Furthermore, the approach reduces computational effort and noise sensitivity. Guiding-center orbits are computed without taking collisions into account. For various simulations in magnetic confinement fusion, direct modeling of guiding-center particle orbits is utilized, e.g. global kinetic computations of quasi-steady plasma parameters or fast alpha particle loss estimation for stellarator optimization. In such complex simulations a simple interface for the guiding-center orbit integration part is needed. Namely, the initial condition in five-dimensional phase space is provided (e.g. guiding-center position, parallel and perpendicular velocity) and the main interest is in the condition after a prescribed time step while the integration process itself is irrelevant. Such a pure “orbit time step routine” acting as an interface with a plasma physics simulation is provided (`orbit\_timestep\_gorilla`). However, the integration process itself can be of high interest as well, thus, a program allowing the detailed analysis of guiding-center orbits, the time evolution of their respective invariants of motion and Poincaré plots is at disposal as well (`gorilla\_plot`). Both applications are realized for demonstration in the program (`test\_gorilla\_main`).   References: [1] M. Eder, C.G. Albert, L.M.P. Bauer, S.V. Kasilov and W.

This interpolation method exactly preserves the order of the RK4 integrating scheme which is crucial for the investigation of fast particle trajectories in 3D magnetic structures such as helical saturated tokamak plasma states, stellarator geometry and resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP). The initialisation of particles with respect to the guiding-centre is discussed. Two approaches to implement RMPs in orbit simulations are presented, one where the vacuum field is added to the 2D equilibrium, creating islands and stochastic regions, the other considering 3D nested flux-surfaces equilibrium including the RMPs.},

	abstract = {We study symplectic numerical integration of mechanical systems with a Hamiltonian specified in non-canonical coordinates and its application to guiding-center motion of charged plasma particles in magnetic confinement devices. The technique combines time-stepping in canonical coordinates with quadrature in non-canonical coordinates and is applicable in systems where a global transformation to canonical coordinates is known explicitly but its inverse is not. A fully implicit class of symplectic Runge-Kutta schemes has recently been introduced and applied to guiding-center motion by Zhang et al. (2014) [9]. Here a generalization of this approach with emphasis on semi-implicit partitioned schemes is described together with methods to enhance performance, in particular avoiding evaluation of non-canonical variables at full time steps. For application in toroidal plasma confinement configurations with nested magnetic flux surfaces a global canonicalization of coordinates for the guiding-center Lagrangian by a spatial transform is presented that allows for pre-computation of the required map in a parallel algorithm in the case of time-independent magnetic field geometry. Guiding-center orbits are studied in stationary magnetic equilibrium fields of an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator configuration. Superior long-term properties of symplectic methods are demonstrated in comparison to a conventional adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme. Finally statistics of fast fusion alpha particle losses over their slowing-down time are computed in the stellarator field on a representative sample, reaching a speed-up of the symplectic Euler scheme by more than a factor three compared to usual Runge-Kutta schemes while keeping the same statistical accuracy and linear scaling with the number of computing threads.},

It is found that the damping rate of the geodesic-acoustic-mode (GAM) oscillation becomes faster than that predicted from a single-surface transport analysis.

An adiabatic electron model has been used. Some verification exercises of XGC1 have been presented. The simulation volume extends from the magnetic axis to the pedestal top inside the magnetic separatrix. Central heating is applied, and a number, momentum and energy conserving linearized Monte Carlo Coulomb collision is used. In the turbulent region, the ion temperature gradient profile self-organizes globally around R/LT = (Rd logT/dr = major radius on the magnetic axis/temperature gradient length) ≃6.5–7, which is somewhat above the conventional nonlinear criticality of ≃6. The self-organized ion temperature gradient profile is approximately stiff against variation of heat source magnitude. Results indicate that the relaxation to a self-organized state proceeds in two phases, namely, a transient phase of excessively bursty transport followed by a 1/f avalanching phase. The bursty types of behaviour are allowed by the quasi-periodic collapse of local E × B shearing barriers.},
